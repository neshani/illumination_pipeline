I need to illustrate a book with this genre/vibe: '{vibe}'.
Please generate {num_styles} distinct visual style descriptions.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:
You must define these styles by referencing specific ARTISTS, ART MOVEMENTS, or PHOTOGRAPHERS.
Do not just say "oil painting." Say "Oil painting in the style of John Singer Sargent and Greg Rutkowski."

For each style, combine:
1. A specific medium (e.g., Watercolor, 35mm film, Charcoal, Digital Impasto).
2. Two or three specific artist names that fit the vibe (mix classic and modern).
3. Lighting and Color keywords.

Return ONLY a Python-parseable list of strings. Do not describe subject matter.

Example Output:
1. Concept art style by Simon Stålenhag and Syd Mead, volumetric fog, desaturated industrial palette
2. 1970s film photography style of William Eggleston, harsh flash, high contrast, kodachrome
3. Ink and watercolor illustration by Arthur Rackham and Yoshitaka Amano, ethereal lighting, muted earth tones
